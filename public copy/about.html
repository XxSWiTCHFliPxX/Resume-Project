<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is David Aparicio. I'm a believer. I believe that peoples dreams should become reealities.
When I decided to chase my dream of beiing a professional skateboarder, people said it was a crazy idea.
They were right, it was a crazy good idea. I travfeled the world, met amazing people and made amazing friendships. 
When I told people I'd perform live EDM shows as a professional D.J. people once again said it wasnt realistic.
3 years and countless shows later, I've proven those who doubted wrong again. For my next trick, I'm working as a Full-Stack Web Developer.
